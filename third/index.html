    <p class = "status-bar">Consider hiding the status bar - and all other app UI - While people are 
        actively viewing full-screen media. If you hide the status bar, be sure 
        to let people retrieve it (and the appropriate app UI) with a single tap. 
        Unless you have a compelling reason to do so, avoid defining a custom 
        gesture to redisplay the status bar because users are unlikely to discover 
        such a gesture or to remember it.</p>
